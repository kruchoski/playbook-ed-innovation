## About This Project

### Editing the Stylesheets

This project uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/ "Link to Learn More About Sass") for managing its style sheets. These styles are defined in the [`styles.scss` file](assets/_sass/styles.scss). We use [Jekyll's native SASS support](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/) to auto-generates the required CSS when you run the site locally, as described above.
